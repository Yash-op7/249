## ðŸ”¹ 4. Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication (AuthN)** = _Who are you?_
    
    - Login with password, OAuth, etc.
        
- **Authorization (AuthZ)** = _What are you allowed to do?_
    
    - E.g., an authenticated user may not have admin privileges.
        

ðŸ‘‰ AuthN happens first, then AuthZ decisions are made.
