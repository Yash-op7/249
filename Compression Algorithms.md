## 🔹 What Is Data Compression?

**Data compression** is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. The goal is to reduce the size of data for storage, transmission, or efficiency, **without losing any information** (in **lossless** compression).

#### 🔹 Why Is This Possible Without Losing Info?

Because:

1. **Redundancy** exists in most raw data.
    
2. Compression uses clever mathematical models to **represent the same info more efficiently**.
    
3. No information is discarded—just **encoded differently**.

## 🔹 How Does Lossless Compression Work?

Lossless compression relies on identifying and exploiting **patterns, redundancies, or statistical properties** in the data.

Here’s a general idea of how it works:

### 1. **Pattern Recognition**

If the data contains repeating elements, we can replace those patterns with **shorter representations**.

Example:
```
Original: AAAABBBCCDAA
Compressed: 4A3B2C1D2A  (Run-Length Encoding)
```

### 2. **Dictionary Encoding**

If certain sequences appear frequently, we can store them in a **dictionary**, and then refer to them with short codes.

- **Lempel-Ziv (LZ77, LZ78)** and its variants (like **ZIP, PNG**) use this.
    
- Example: "the cat and the hat" →
- 
```
Input: "the cat and the hat"
Dictionary: 1: the 2: cat 3: and 4: hat  
Encoded: 1 2 3 1 4 
```
    

### 3. **Entropy Encoding**

This involves assigning shorter codes to more frequent elements and longer codes to less frequent ones.

- **Huffman Coding**: Builds a binary tree where frequent characters get shorter codes.
    
- **Arithmetic Coding**: Encodes the entire message as a single number between 0 and 1 based on probabilities.
    

Example:

```
Char frequencies:
A: 50%, B: 25%, C: 25%
Huffman codes:
A: 0
B: 10
C: 11
Message: AABAC → 0010011
```

## 🔹 How Can It Be Decompressed Perfectly?

Because the compression algorithm uses **reversible transformations**, the original data can be **reconstructed exactly**.

Each compressed format includes:

- Enough information to reverse the transformation.
    
- Possibly a dictionary or tree structure for decoding.
    

> **Key principle:** Lossless compression is **invertible**. The decompression algorithm is the **inverse** of the compression algorithm.

## 🔹 Common Lossless Compression Algorithms

|Algorithm|Technique Used|Used In|
|---|---|---|
|Huffman Coding|Entropy Coding|GZIP, MP3 (partial)|
|LZ77 / LZ78|Dictionary-based|ZIP, PNG|
|DEFLATE|LZ77 + Huffman|ZIP, PNG|
|BWT + MTF|Reordering + Entropy Coding|bzip2|
|Arithmetic Coding|Probability-based encoding|JPEG (lossless), MPEG-4|

## 🔸 In Summary

**Lossless compression works by finding patterns or redundancies in data and replacing them with more compact representations.** The key is that every step is reversible, so you can decompress to get back the exact original data.
