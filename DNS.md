## ‚úÖ What is DNS?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is like the **phonebook of the internet**. It translates **human-friendly domain names** (like `example.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `93.184.216.34`) that computers use to identify each other.

## üîÅ High-Level DNS Resolution Flow

When you type `example.com` into your browser:

1. **Browser Cache**: Checks if the domain is already resolved.
    
2. **OS Cache**: Asks your operating system's resolver.
    
3. **Local DNS Resolver (often your ISP)**: If OS doesn‚Äôt know, it asks the DNS resolver.
    
4. **Recursive Lookup**:
    
    - **Root Server**: Points to `.com` TLD server.
        
    - **TLD Server**: Points to `example.com`‚Äôs authoritative name server.
        
    - **Authoritative Name Server**: Returns the IP for `example.com`.
        
5. IP is returned ‚Üí browser connects to the IP ‚Üí page loads.

## üß† Key Concepts

### 1. **DNS Record Types**

- `A`: Maps domain to IPv4 address.
    
- `AAAA`: Maps domain to IPv6 address.
    
- `CNAME`: Alias to another domain.
    
- `MX`: Mail exchange server (email routing).
    
- `NS`: Delegates domain to name servers.
    
- `TXT`: Arbitrary text data (used for SPF, verification).
    
- `SRV`: Service records (e.g., VoIP).
    
- `PTR`: Reverse DNS (IP ‚Üí domain name).
    

> **Backend-relevant**: Know `A`, `CNAME`, `MX`, and `TXT` (for email, verification, DNS-based configuration).

### 2. **Caching**

- DNS responses are **cached** to improve speed and reduce load.
    
- Controlled by **TTL (Time to Live)** set in the DNS record.
    
- Be aware of **propagation delays** when updating DNS.
    

---

### 3. **Recursive vs Authoritative DNS**

- **Recursive Resolver**: Client-facing; handles full resolution process.
    
- **Authoritative Name Server**: Stores actual DNS records for a domain.
    

> **Example**: AWS Route 53 can be used as an authoritative name server.

---

### 4. **DNS Propagation**

- Changes to DNS records take time to propagate across all DNS resolvers globally.
    
- TTL and caching affect how long changes take to reflect.
    

---

### 5. **CDNs & DNS**

- CDNs (like Cloudflare, Akamai) use DNS to route users to the nearest edge server.
    
- Often set up using a `CNAME` record pointing to the CDN.
    

---

## üîê DNS & Security

### Common issues:

- **DNS Spoofing / Cache Poisoning**: Fake IPs returned from compromised DNS servers.
    
- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**: Encrypts DNS queries.
    
- **DNSSEC**: Adds authenticity to DNS responses via cryptographic signatures.

## üí° Backend Interview Relevance

Interviewers might expect you to understand DNS in these contexts:

### 1. **Deployment / DevOps**

- How do you configure DNS for a new backend service?
    
- What happens when you change a DNS record?
    
- Why isn‚Äôt your new deployment reachable after updating the DNS?
    

### 2. **System Design**

- How to handle traffic routing via DNS?
    
- How CDNs or failover mechanisms use DNS?
    
- How to design a global service with DNS-based geo-routing?
    

### 3. **Troubleshooting**

- ‚ÄúWhy is my domain not resolving?‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúWhy does it work on my machine but not for others?‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúWhat tools can you use to debug DNS issues?‚Äù
    
    - `dig`, `nslookup`, `host`, `ping`, `traceroute`

## ‚öíÔ∏è Tools You Should Know

- `dig example.com`: See detailed DNS info.
    
- `nslookup example.com`: Query DNS info.
    
- DNS provider dashboards (e.g., Route 53, Cloudflare).
    
- Online tools: `dnschecker.org`, `mxtoolbox.com`.
