## ✅ 1. What is Multithreading?

**Multithreading** means running **multiple threads of execution** within a single process.

Each thread runs _independently_ but shares:

- The same **memory space** (heap, global vars)
- The same **file descriptors**, etc.

This allows:

- **Concurrency** (overlapping tasks)
- **Responsiveness** (UI thread + background threads)
- **Better CPU utilization** (especially on multi-core machines)

---

## 🧵 2. Thread Lifecycle

A thread goes through these stages:

|Stage|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**New**|Created but not yet running|
|**Runnable**|Ready to run, waiting for CPU|
|**Running**|Actively executing on a CPU core|
|**Blocked**|Waiting (e.g. for I/O or lock)|
|**Terminated**|Finished execution|

#### Threads in C++
## 🔢 Step 1: What is a thread?

A **thread** is a lightweight unit of execution that runs inside a process. Threads share memory and resources, unlike separate processes.

In C++, threads are supported via the **`<thread>`** header since C++11.
## 🔤 Step 2: Basic Thread Syntax

### ✅ Include header:

```cpp
#include <thread>
```

### ✅ Define a function that the thread will run:

```cpp
void myFunction() {
    // do some work
}
```

### ✅ Start a thread:

```cpp
std::thread t1(myFunction); // t1 starts running myFunction
```

### ✅ Wait for the thread to finish:

```cpp
t1.join();
```
## 🔗 What does `.join()` mean?

`thread.join()` means:

> "Wait for this thread to finish before continuing."

### Example:

```cpp
std::thread t1(doSomething);
t1.join();  // main thread will wait here until t1 is done
```

❗If you **don’t call `.join()` or `.detach()`**, your program will crash (terminate) at runtime.

## 🕸️ 3. Concurrency vs Parallelism

These terms sound similar but differ:

| Term            | Meaning                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Concurrency** | Multiple tasks are in progress but only one runs at any time — others wait — interleaving happens — all on one CPU core. |
| **Parallelism** | Multiple tasks are _executing_ at the same moment (simultaneous)                                                         |
## 🔍 ⭐⭐ Think of It Like This:

|Concept|Analogy|
|---|---|
|**Concurrency**|A single chef cooking 5 dishes, switching between them constantly.|
|**Parallelism**|5 chefs each cooking 1 dish at the same time in 5 different kitchens.|
### 📌 Key point:

- Single-core CPU = **Concurrency** via context switching.
- Multi-core CPU = **Parallelism** (true simultaneous execution).
    
- **Concurrency** is about **managing multiple tasks at once** — even if **only one is actively running at a given moment**.
- This is possible via **context switching**: the CPU rapidly switches between tasks so it _feels_ like they’re running at the same time.
- Used when there’s **a single CPU core** (or even on multiple cores if needed).
- whereas **Parallelism** is "Different tasks running simultaneously, on multiple CPU cores, since one core can only run one process at a time."
- Parallelism is about **doing many things at the same time** — literally.
    
- This **requires multiple CPU cores** or CPUs.
    
- Example: If you have a 4-core CPU, 4 independent tasks can run **in true parallel** (one on each core).
## 💡 Important Distinction:

- **Concurrency is a design/structure concept**: “Can my system _handle_ multiple things at once?”
    
- **Parallelism is a physical execution concept**: “Are multiple things actually _running_ at the same instant?”
    

They’re **not mutually exclusive**:

- A system can be **concurrent but not parallel** (e.g., Node.js on one core).
    
- A system can be **parallel but not concurrent** (e.g., one task broken into subtasks running on multiple cores).
    
- Ideally, modern systems are **both**: concurrent design + parallel execution.
---

## 🧱 4. Synchronization Primitives

Since threads share memory, you need **tools to coordinate access and avoid chaos** these tools are called **Synchronization Primitives**:

### 🔓 `Mutex` (Mutual Exclusion)

- Ensures **only one thread** can access a critical section at a time.
- In C/C++: `std::mutex`, `pthread_mutex_t`
```cpp
std::mutex mtx;

void thread_func() {
    mtx.lock();
    // critical section
    mtx.unlock();
}
```

- Think of a **mutex** as a _key to a locked room_.
- Only **one thread at a time** can hold the key and enter the room (critical section).
- Other threads wanting to enter the room **have to wait** until the key is released.
- This ensures only one thread is doing something important in that critical section, preventing conflicts.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Imagine a bathroom with only one key — only one person can be inside at a time. If someone’s inside, others wait outside.

###### Mutex example: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx;
int counter = 0;

void increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
        mtx.lock();           // lock the mutex before entering critical section
        ++counter;            // critical section: modify shared variable
        mtx.unlock();         // unlock mutex after critical section
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment);
    std::thread t2(increment);

    t1.join(); // ensures main thread waits until both threads finish.
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << counter << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### 🧃 `Semaphore`

- Allows **N threads** to access a resource (vs 1 with mutex).
- Great for managing limited resources (like connections).
- A semaphore is like a _set of keys_ — say, N keys.
- It allows up to **N threads** to access a resource simultaneously.
- Great for managing a **limited resource** like database connections or seats in a theater.
- If all N keys are taken, other threads must wait until a key is returned.

**Real-life analogy:**  
A parking lot with 5 spots: only 5 cars (threads) can park at once; the 6th car must wait. > _"Can I think of a semaphore as a set of keys to an office, only people with a key can enter the office and use the resources, and others must wait until keys are free?"_

**Yes, exactly!**  
That’s a perfectly good analogy — in fact, it might be clearer than the parking lot one. The **keys represent permission tokens**. When someone gets a key, they can enter and use the office (shared resource). When done, they return the key, letting others in.

The **parking lot analogy** is about limited spots (resources), but your _keys_ analogy highlights the _control_ aspect (semaphore controls access).

**Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <semaphore>
#include <vector>

std::counting_semaphore<3> semaphore(3);  // allows up to 3 threads concurrently

void worker(int id) {
    semaphore.acquire();  // acquire a key
    std::cout << "Worker " << id << " is working\n";
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Worker " << id << " is done\n";
    semaphore.release();  // release the key
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(worker, i);
    }

    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
##### 🔍 Flow:

1. You create a semaphore with `3` "permits" (keys).
2. Only **3 threads at a time** can enter the work section.
3. `acquire()` waits if no permit is available.
4. When a thread finishes, it calls `release()` to let others in.

This is useful when you have limited resources (e.g., DB connections, limited seats).
### 🧪 `Condition Variable`

- Lets threads **wait** for some condition to be true.
- Useful for **producer-consumer** problems.
- Lets threads **wait until some condition becomes true** before proceeding.
- Useful when threads depend on some event — like waiting for data to be produced.
- Example: A _producer_ thread creates data, a _consumer_ thread waits until data is ready.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Waiting for a bus: you wait (sleep) until the bus arrives (condition becomes true), then you proceed.

### 🎢 `Atomic variables`

- Provide **lock-free thread-safe access** to variables.
- In C++: `std::atomic<int>`
- Special variables that provide **thread-safe operations without locks**.
- Operations on atomic variables (like incrementing a counter) happen **completely without interruption**.
- Useful when you want to update a shared variable quickly and safely without the overhead of locking.
- Safer and faster than mutex for simple updates.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<int> atomic_counter(0);

void increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
        atomic_counter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment);
    std::thread t2(increment);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Final atomic counter value: " << atomic_counter.load() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```


#### 👷🏼 **What does thread-safe mean?**

- **Thread-safe** means:  
    You can safely access or modify something from **multiple threads at the same time** without causing errors or corrupting data.
    
- Without thread-safety, if two threads update the same variable simultaneously, data could get mixed up or lost.

#### **What is a thread-safe operation without locks?**

- Usually, to protect shared data, threads use locks (mutexes) to make sure only one thread updates data at a time.
- **Lock-free thread-safe operations** avoid using locks. Instead, they rely on special hardware instructions that guarantee the operation completes atomically — indivisibly.
#### **"Operations on atomic variables happen without interruption" — what does this mean?**

- It means that the operation is **guaranteed to complete fully** before another thread can see the variable in a half-changed state.
- There is **no waiting for a lock** because these operations use CPU instructions like **compare-and-swap (CAS)** or **atomic increment**.
- So, **yes**, the operation is performed “immediately” and safely, without lock overhead.
#### **Is concurrent read/write of atomic variables handled internally by the OS?**

- Not exactly by the OS, but by **special CPU instructions and hardware support**.
- These instructions ensure that reads/writes are done atomically, so the variable is never in an inconsistent state.
- The compiler and CPU work together to generate machine code that makes these atomic guarantees.
#### ⭐ **analogy for atomic variables**

Imagine a **magic cash register** that **counts money correctly even if multiple cashiers try to add or remove money at the same time**:

- No cashier has to wait for a lock or stop what they’re doing.
- The register magically ensures that every single coin added or removed is accounted for correctly, even when multiple cashiers operate simultaneously.
- This means you never get a wrong total or missing coins because of conflicting updates.


## Real-world example: 🏦 Bank Account with threads

This shows how to pass **shared objects by reference** to threads safely.

### 🔐 Goal:

- Shared bank account object
- Multiple threads **deposit** and **withdraw** money
- Use a **mutex** to avoid race conditions
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

class BankAccount {
private:
    int balance;
    std::mutex mtx; // protect balance

public:
    BankAccount(int initial) : balance(initial) {}

    void deposit(int amount) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        balance += amount;
        std::cout << "Deposited " << amount << ", New Balance: " << balance << '\n';
    }

    void withdraw(int amount) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            std::cout << "Withdrew " << amount << ", New Balance: " << balance << '\n';
        } else {
            std::cout << "Withdrawal of " << amount << " failed. Balance: " << balance << '\n';
        }
    }

    int getBalance() {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        return balance;
    }
};

void depositTask(BankAccount& account) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        account.deposit(100);
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    }
}

void withdrawTask(BankAccount& account) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        account.withdraw(50);
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(150));
    }
}

int main() {
    BankAccount myAccount(500); // start with 500

    std::thread t1(depositTask, std::ref(myAccount));
    std::thread t2(withdrawTask, std::ref(myAccount));

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Final Balance: " << myAccount.getBalance() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

## ⚠️ 5. Race Conditions

When two or more threads **access shared data at the same time** and the **final result depends on timing**, you get a **race condition**.

### Example:

```cpp
int counter = 0;

void thread_func() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)
        counter++;
}
```

If two threads run this simultaneously:

- They might both read the same value.
- They might both write back the same value.
- You’ll **lose updates** → result is less than 2000!

### 💡 Fix: Use `mutex` or `atomic` to guard access.

---

## 🔒 6. Deadlocks

A **deadlock** happens when two or more threads are **waiting on each other forever**, and nothing can proceed.

### Example:

```cpp
// Thread A
lock(mutex1);
lock(mutex2);

// Thread B
lock(mutex2);
lock(mutex1);
```

- Thread A has mutex1 and waits for mutex2.
- Thread B has mutex2 and waits for mutex1.
- Both are stuck. Forever.

### 🔓 How to avoid deadlocks:

- Always lock mutexes in **the same global order**.
- Use **try-lock** and timeouts.
- Avoid **nested locking** if possible.

---

## 📋 7. Common Threading Patterns

### 🛠 Producer-Consumer

- One or more threads produce data.
- One or more threads consume it.
- Use `queue + mutex + condition_variable`.

### 🪙 Thread Pool

- Pre-create N threads that wait for tasks.
- Avoids the cost of frequent thread creation.
- Used in servers and async libraries.

### ⛓ Fork-Join

- Split a task into parts, run in parallel, then combine the result.
