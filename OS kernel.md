The **kernel** is the **core part of the [[OS]]**. It acts as a **bridge between applications and the physical hardware**.

### üéØ Responsibilities of the Kernel:

|Responsibility|Description|
|---|---|
|üß† **Memory Management**|Controls and allocates RAM between applications|
|‚öôÔ∏è **Process Management**|Starts, schedules, and stops programs (called processes)|
|üíæ **File System Management**|Manages files and directories on storage|
|üñ•Ô∏è **Device Management**|Talks to hardware (CPU, disk, network, etc.) via drivers|
|üîí **Security & Permissions**|Controls user access to resources|

## üß© **How the Kernel Works**

Let‚Äôs walk through an example:

Say you run a Python app:

```bash
python myapp.py
```

Here‚Äôs what happens step by step:

1. The shell (e.g., bash) tells the **OS** to run a program.
    
2. The **kernel**:
    
    - Loads the Python interpreter into memory
        
    - Allocates memory
        
    - Gives it a **process ID**
        
    - Starts the program on a CPU core
        
    - Manages input/output (I/O), like reading a file or network
        

All of this is done **by the kernel**. Applications don‚Äôt talk to hardware directly ‚Äî they **ask the kernel to do it** on their behalf.

## üõ†Ô∏è Two Key Modes: User Space vs Kernel Space

- **User Space**: Where applications like browsers, editors, games run.
    
- **Kernel Space**: Where the kernel runs. Has full access to hardware.
    

> Applications cannot directly access hardware ‚Äî they must go through the **kernel** using **system calls**.

This protects the system from bugs or malicious code.

---

## üìû What Are System Calls?

> A **system call** is how a program requests a service from the kernel.

Example: `read()`, `write()`, `open()`, `fork()` ‚Äî all system calls.

When your program needs to:

- Open a file
    
- Allocate memory
    
- Send data over the network  
    It makes a **system call**, and the **kernel handles it** securely and efficiently.
    Each **system call** is a **separate request** to the kernel, and the kernel only grants access or performs the service **for that specific call**.

#### üîÅ System Calls Are One-Off, Not Persistent Access

System calls are **discrete**, one-time interactions with the kernel. Here's how it works:

1. Your app wants to read a file.
    
2. It issues a system call: `read(fd, buffer, size)`
    
3. The kernel checks permissions, reads the data, fills the buffer.
    
4. The call returns to the app with the result.
    

üëâ If your app wants to read more data:

- It must **call `read()` again**.
    
- It does **not retain some persistent "open channel"** to the hardware outside of what the kernel explicitly allows through file descriptors. Example:
```cpp
int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);   // System call #1
read(fd, buffer, 100);                 // System call #2
read(fd, buffer, 100);                 // System call #3
close(fd);                             // System call #4
```

## üß± Kernel and Containers

Here‚Äôs why the kernel matters in the context of **Docker and containers**:

### ‚úÖ Containers share the host OS kernel

Unlike Virtual Machines (which each have their own OS), **containers share the host‚Äôs kernel** ‚Äî but run in **isolated environments**.

That‚Äôs made possible by two Linux kernel features:

### 1. **Namespaces** (Isolation)

Namespaces create isolated views of system resources, such as:

- Process IDs (`pid`)
    
- Network interfaces (`net`)
    
- Filesystems (`mnt`)
    
- Hostnames (`uts`)
    

Each container thinks it‚Äôs the only thing on the system ‚Äî but it‚Äôs just a namespace.

### 2. **Control Groups (cgroups)** (Resource limits)

Cgroups limit how much CPU, memory, or disk I/O a container can use.

So even though all containers share the same kernel:

- They can‚Äôt see each other (thanks to **namespaces**)
    
- They can‚Äôt hog resources (thanks to **cgroups**)

Think of your computer like an apartment building:

| Layer         | Analogy             | Role                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware      | The building itself | Physical CPU, RAM, disk                                                                 |
| Kernel        | Building manager    | Gives tenants controlled access to water, power, elevators                              |
| User programs | Tenants             | Run inside their own apartments, query manager for one-time action via kernel mediation |
| Containers    | Rooms/apartments    | Isolated, but share same water/power (kernel)                                           |
