- [[Multithreading]]

- A **process** is an instance of a running program.
- It‚Äôs like a **container** that holds everything needed for a program to run:
    - Its **own virtual address space** (memory)
    - **Code** (instructions)
    - **Data** (variables, heap, stack)
    - **System resources** (open files, network sockets)
    - Its **own state** or **[[Execution context]]** (registers, program counter, etc.)
- Processes are **independent** from each other. They have isolated memory spaces ‚Äî so one process can‚Äôt accidentally (or intentionally) modify another‚Äôs memory.
- In OS terms, a process is the unit of resource allocation and scheduling.
‚≠ê**Analogy:** Think of a process as a **self-contained ship** with its own crew, supplies, and maps.

## What is a **Thread**?

- A **thread** is the smallest unit of CPU execution inside a process.
- A process can have **one or more threads**.
- Threads within the **same process share**:
    - The **same virtual address space** (memory)
    - File descriptors, global variables, heap
- But each thread has its own [[Execution context]]:
    - **CPU registers**
    - **Program counter**
    - **Stack** (for function calls and local variables)
- Threads allow a program to do **multiple things at the same time** (concurrently), like downloading a file while updating the UI.
- Because threads share memory, they are **lighter-weight** than processes but require careful synchronization to avoid conflicts.

**Analogy:** Threads are like **crew members** on the ship working simultaneously on different tasks, sharing the ship‚Äôs resources.

# Real-life example of a multi-threaded process

- **Web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox):**
    - Each tab can be a separate process, but inside a process, there are multiple threads handling UI, networking, rendering, JavaScript execution, etc.
- **Word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word):**
    - One thread handles user input, another autosaves in background, another spellchecks, etc.
- **Servers (e.g., web servers like Nginx, Apache, NOT node & express):**
    - Multiple threads handle incoming requests in parallel.
### ‚ùì **Does a Node.js (Express) server use multiple threads if more than one request comes in at the same time?**

**Short Answer:**  
**No**, not in the way traditional multi-threaded servers (like Java or Apache) do.  
Node.js is **single-threaded** in terms of handling JavaScript execution, but it can handle **multiple concurrent requests** efficiently through its **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**, and it **does use threads internally** for certain operations via the **libuv thread pool**.

---

### üîç **Deeper Explanation**

#### 1. **Single-Threaded Event Loop**

- Node.js runs JavaScript code in a **single thread** using an **event loop**.
    
- When you define routes and controllers in Express, they're executed on the **main thread**.
    
- The event loop handles incoming requests one at a time in the sense that it picks them off a queue and invokes your handler code.
    

#### 2. **Non-Blocking I/O and Concurrency**

- I/O operations (like file system access, database calls, or network requests) are handled **asynchronously**.
    
- When you perform something like `fs.readFile()` or make an HTTP call inside a route handler, Node **delegates that to a background thread** from the **libuv thread pool**.
    
- This allows Node.js to **process other requests while waiting** for those I/O operations to complete.
    

#### 3. **libuv Thread Pool (Behind the Scenes)**

- libuv is the C library Node uses under the hood for non-blocking I/O.
    
- It uses a **thread pool** (default 4 threads) for things like:
    
    - File system operations
        
    - DNS lookups
        
    - Some crypto functions
        
- So while your JavaScript is single-threaded, some **blocking tasks are offloaded** to this pool.
    

#### 4. **Multiple Requests at the Same Time?**

- Yes, if two users hit your Express route at the same time, Node.js:
    
    - Queues both requests
        
    - Starts processing the first
        
    - If the first hits a non-blocking async operation (e.g., DB call), Node continues processing the second
        
- This is **concurrent**, but not multi-threaded in the traditional sense.
    

---

### üß† Example

```js
app.get('/slow', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await someSlowDbCall(); // async, non-blocking
  res.send(result);
});
```

- If 10 users hit `/slow`, Node.js won‚Äôt spin 10 threads.
- It‚Äôll start the first one, offload the DB call, and keep handling others.
- The DB work might run in a separate thread (handled by the DB driver or libuv), but your Express code is still single-threaded.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Want True Multithreading?

If you want true parallel execution in Node.js, you can use:

- **Worker Threads**: A Node.js module (`worker_threads`) for actual JS multithreading.
- **Child Processes / Clustering**: Forking processes to utilize multiple CPU cores.

### ‚úÖ Summary

|Feature|Node.js (Express) Server|
|---|---|
|JavaScript execution model|Single-threaded|
|Handles concurrent requests|Yes|
|True multithreading|No (not by default)|
|Uses background threads|Yes (libuv thread pool)|
|Can be scaled to use threads|Yes (via worker threads)|

# What are CPU cores exactly?

- A **CPU core** is an independent processing unit inside a physical CPU chip.
- Each core can execute its own thread/instruction stream **independently** at the same time.
- Modern CPUs have multiple cores (2, 4, 8, 16, or more) to do **true parallelism** ‚Äî multiple threads/processes running simultaneously.
- Think of CPU cores as **separate workers** in a factory. More cores = more workers = more work done in parallel.
