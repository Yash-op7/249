- Spearheaded infrastructure migration from monolithic EC2 to cloud-native Kubernetes (EKS) microservices with IaC using Terraform and Helm, achieving 99.9% uptime, zero-downtime deployments, and 80% faster release cycles via GitHub Actions CI/CD.

- Architected single-click multi-tenant AWS deployment solution enabling enterprise clients to deploy infrastructure in their own cloud accounts, driving 3x increase in enterprise customer acquisition and significant revenue growth.

- Designed and built cloud-native Web Recorder Service from scratch, migrating Electron desktop app to scalable microservices, enabling browser test recording without local installations and increasing customer onboarding by 40%.

- Built real-time browser session management using WebSocket, Playwright automation, and modified Chrome DevTools frontend

for live remote browser view, with FSx volumes for optimized performance across containerized environments.

- Implemented event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka (MSK) for asynchronous inter-service communication across 10+

microservices, improving reliability and enabling horizontal scalability with HPA and Karpenter auto-scaling.

- Deployed Ingress-NGINX for load balancing and geo-routing with Cloudflare CDN for global low-latency access, and integrated

ELK Stack for centralized logging and Prometheus-Grafana for monitoring with intelligent alerting, reducing MTTR by 65%.

- Integrated OpenAI GPT API for intelligent test automation, auto-generating descriptive step names and implementing

self-healing test scripts that detect element changes and suggest code fixes, improving test maintenance efficiency by 50%.

- Optimized cloud infrastructure costs by 50% through strategic resource allocation, spot instances, and workload optimization while

maintaining high availability and security standards.
