## 🔹 1. TCP vs UDP Speed + Use Cases

Yes, your intuition is correct:

- **TCP is slower than UDP** because of its overhead:
    
    - 3-way handshake before sending data.
        
    - Reliability (ACKs, retransmissions).
        
    - Flow + congestion control.
        
    - State tracking in OS.
        
- **UDP is faster** because it just sends packets blindly — no connection, no ACK, no ordering.  
    But ⚠️ "faster" doesn’t always mean "better". It depends on the use case.
    

### Examples

- **TCP Use Cases** (reliability is critical):
    
    - Web traffic: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2.
        
    - Email: SMTP, IMAP, POP3.
        
    - File transfer: FTP, SFTP.
        
    - APIs, DB connections.
        
- **UDP Use Cases** (speed > reliability):
    
    - DNS (quick, small requests).
        
    - Video/voice streaming (a dropped packet is better than waiting).
        
    - Gaming (low latency > guaranteed delivery).
        
    - QUIC (uses UDP as transport but adds reliability itself).
        

So:  
👉 TCP = reliability and ordering.  
👉 UDP = low latency, small packets, tolerate some loss.
