## ðŸ”¥ Why This Topic Matters

When a database is **replicated across nodes (servers)**, you need a way to ensure that **all replicas stay consistent**, even when:

- Nodes fail
- Networks are slow or unreliable
- Some replicas are down

To do this, **databases** use **commit protocols** (like **2-phase** and **3-phase commit**) and **consensus algorithms** (like **Paxos**, **Raft**, etc.).
