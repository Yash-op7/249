## 1. What is Virtual Memory?

At its simplest:

**Virtual memory** is an abstraction that gives each process its own **private address space**, separate from physical RAM.

- Your program sees a continuous, private block of addresses (like 0x0000_0000 to 0xFFFF_FFFF).
    
- The OS and hardware translate these **virtual addresses** into actual **physical memory addresses** (RAM).
    
- This means **multiple processes can run at the same time, each thinking it owns the whole memory**.
---
## 2. Why Do We Need Virtual Memory?

- **Isolation:** Each process is protected from accessing others‚Äô memory (security).
    
- **Convenience:** Programs can use more memory than physically available (via swapping).
    
- **Flexibility:** The OS can move pages of memory in and out of physical RAM transparently.
    
- **Simplifies programming:** Programs use simple, continuous addresses without worrying about physical layout.
---
## 3. Key Concepts in Virtual Memory

### a) Virtual Address Space

- Each process gets its own virtual address space.
    
- On 64-bit systems, this can be very large (terabytes).
    
- The OS maps parts of this space to physical memory or disk.
    

### b) Physical Memory

- The actual RAM installed on the machine.
    
- Limited resource shared among processes.
    

### c) Pages and Page Frames

- Memory is managed in fixed-size chunks called **pages**.
    
- Common page size is 4 KB (4096 bytes).
    
- Virtual memory is divided into pages.
    
- Physical memory is divided into **page frames** (same size).
---
## 4. How Virtual Memory Works: The Translation Process

### Step 1: CPU generates a virtual address (VA)

- When your program accesses memory, it uses a VA.
    

### Step 2: Memory Management Unit (MMU) translates VA to physical address (PA)

- The **MMU** uses a data structure called a **page table** to find which physical page frame corresponds to the VA.
    

### Step 3: Access memory at physical address

- If the page is in RAM (page frame allocated), access continues.
    
- If not (page fault), OS handles it (e.g., load page from disk).

---

## 5. Page Tables

- Data structure that maps **virtual pages** to **physical frames**.
    
- Each process has its own page table.
    
- Contains info about:
    
    - Whether page is in RAM
        
    - Permissions (read/write/execute)
        
    - Whether page is dirty or clean
        
    - And other flags
        

---

## 6. Page Faults

When the CPU tries to access a VA that:

- Is **not mapped to a physical page**, or
    
- The page is **not currently in RAM**
    

The MMU triggers a **page fault** exception.

- OS catches this.
    
- If the page is on disk (swap or file-backed), OS loads it into a free physical page.
    
- Updates page table.
    
- Resumes the process.
    

---

## 7. Swapping / Paging

- When RAM is full, OS can **swap** pages out to disk (swap space).
    
- Pages not currently needed get saved to disk to free RAM.
    
- When needed again, they are swapped back in.
    
- This enables running programs that require more memory than RAM physically available.
    

---

## 8. Memory Protection and Permissions

Each page can have permissions:

- **Read**
    
- **Write**
    
- **Execute**
    

The MMU and OS ensure processes cannot access memory without proper permissions.

---

## 9. Example: What Happens When You Read a File (Virtual Memory Involved)

- Your program calls `read(fd, buf, size)`.
    
- `buf` is a pointer in virtual memory.
    
- The OS maps `buf`‚Äôs virtual pages to physical memory.
    
- If `buf`'s pages are not in RAM (or not allocated), page faults occur. (see the next section for more elaboration on this point)
    
- OS allocates physical pages and maps them.
    
- Then copies file data into those pages.
    
- Your program accesses `buf` as normal.

## ‚ùì What Does "Not Allocated" Mean in `If buf's pages are not in RAM (or not allocated)`?

Let‚Äôs say your code has:

```c
char *buf = malloc(100000);
```

- This reserves **virtual memory** (pages), but those pages are **not allocated in RAM yet**.
- Only when you **access** (read/write) the buffer does the OS allocate **actual page frames** and map them.

This is called **lazy allocation** ‚Äî the OS waits until the memory is actually used.

So "not allocated" means:

- The virtual page exists in the address space.
- But it **doesn't yet point to a page frame in RAM**.

This will cause a **page fault**, and the OS will allocate a physical page.

## 10. Summary Table

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|Virtual Memory|Each process‚Äôs own virtual address space|
|Physical Memory|Actual RAM|
|Pages|Fixed-size blocks of memory (4 KB usually)|
|Page Table|Maps virtual pages to physical frames|
|MMU|Hardware component translating addresses|
|Page Fault|Exception triggered if page not in RAM|
|Swapping|Moving pages between RAM and disk|
|Permissions|Read/write/execute flags per page|

---

## Bonus: Visual Metaphor

Imagine a **library**:

- Virtual memory = catalog system telling you where a book is.
- Physical memory = the actual shelves.
- Page table = librarian‚Äôs index cards that map book IDs to shelf locations.
- Page fault = librarian realizing the book is not on the shelf but in the storage room, so they fetch it.
- Swapping = moving rarely used books to storage to free shelf space.

## Summary:

- Each process **gets its own virtual address space**.
- This space is **large, private, and continuous** (from the process's point of view).
- But in reality, **only parts of it are actually stored in physical RAM**.
- **Pages** are blocks of memory ‚Äî yes, usually 4KB in size.
- The **OS swaps pages in and out** of RAM from disk as needed.
- **Page tables map** virtual addresses to physical addresses.
- If a page is missing from RAM, it triggers a **page fault**.

|Term|Lives In|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Page**|Virtual Memory|A 4KB block in a process's virtual address space|
|**Page Frame**|Physical Memory (RAM)|A 4KB block of actual RAM where data is stored|

## ‚≠ê What Are Dirty and Clean Pages?

- **Clean Page** = A page in RAM that **hasn't been modified** since it was loaded.
    
    - We can just discard it and re-read it from the disk if needed.
    
- **Dirty Page** = A page that **has been modified**.
    
    - Before removing it from RAM, **it must be written back to disk** so we don't lose data.
    
- #### üîÅ Why this matters:

When RAM is full, and we need to **evict** a page, the OS:

- Prefers evicting **clean pages** (faster, no write-back needed).
- Writes **dirty pages** to disk before eviction.

## ‚ùì How Are Pages Evicted?

When RAM is full, and we need space, the OS uses a **page replacement algorithm** to decide which page to evict, example LRU.
üß† The OS tries to evict pages **least likely to be used soon**.

## ‚ùì How Big Can Virtual Memory Be?

You're thinking critically here! Let's break it down.

### Virtual memory ‚â† available disk

- The **virtual address space** is a **theoretical limit** based on the CPU architecture:
    
    - On a **32-bit** CPU: max virtual address space = 4 GB.
        
    - On a **64-bit** CPU: max = exabytes (enormous), but OS often limits it to e.g. 128 TB.
        
- The actual **physical backing** comes from:
    
    - RAM (main memory)
        
    - Swap space (disk)
        
    - Mapped files
        

üõë But the system **does not pre-allocate disk or RAM** for the entire virtual space!

üí° So yes, you're right ‚Äî we **can‚Äôt store all bits in memory**, but we **don‚Äôt need to**. Most of the address space is unused or lazily allocated.

## ‚ùì What Are Page Permissions (Read, Write, Execute)?

‚≠ê These are **per-page flags** in the page table that control **how the process can use a page**

|Permission|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Read**|Process can read from the page (e.g. `x = a[0]`)|
|**Write**|Process can write to the page (e.g. `a[0] = 5`)|
|**Execute**|Process can execute code from that page (e.g. functions, machine code)|

üö´ Trying to do something not allowed (like writing to a read-only page) causes a **segmentation fault** (`SIGSEGV`).

## üß† Summary Table of Your Questions

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Virtual Address Space|Per-process illusion of large, continuous memory|
|Page|A block of virtual memory (usually 4KB)|
|Page Frame|A physical memory block (same size as a page)|
|Page Table|Maps virtual pages to physical frames|
|Not Mapped vs Not In RAM|"Not mapped" = not used yet, "not in RAM" = swapped out|
|Dirty Page|Modified in RAM, must be saved to disk before eviction|

# ‚≠ê
Let‚Äôs walk through a **real-life example** of what happens in **virtual memory** when you run a program ‚Äî **step by step**, from the moment you type a command in the terminal to when your code executes and uses memory.

---

# üß™ Real-Life Example: Running a Program in Linux

Let‚Äôs say you type:

`./my_program`

Let‚Äôs assume `my_program` is a simple C binary like:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char msg[] = "Hello, World!";
    printf("%s\n", msg);
    return 0;
}
```

Now let‚Äôs break down **what happens in memory** step-by-step ‚Äî focusing on **virtual memory management**.

---

## üî∑ Step 1: You Run the Command

When you type `./my_program`:

1. The **shell** (like `bash` or `zsh`) calls the `execve()` system call.
    
2. The **kernel** loads the program binary (`ELF` file on Linux) into a **new process**.
    
3. A **new virtual address space** is created for this process.
    

---

## üî∑ Step 2: The OS Sets Up Virtual Memory Regions

The OS sets up your process‚Äôs virtual address space like this (simplified):

|Virtual Region|What It Contains|Permissions|
|---|---|---|
|**Text segment**|Your program‚Äôs machine code (`main`, etc.)|Read + Execute|
|**Data segment**|Initialized global/static variables|Read + Write|
|**BSS segment**|Uninitialized globals (`int x;`)|Read + Write|
|**Heap**|Dynamic memory (`malloc`, etc.)|Read + Write|
|**Stack**|Function calls, local vars (`msg[]`)|Read + Write|
|**Shared libs**|Like libc (for `printf`)|Read + Execute|
|**Memory-mapped I/O**|File-backed or special regions|Varies|

üìå All of this is **virtual** memory ‚Äî these are ranges in your process‚Äôs private address space. They don‚Äôt necessarily map to RAM yet.

---

## üî∑ Step 3: Actual Memory Is Allocated Lazily

- **Nothing is actually loaded into RAM yet** except the most essential pages.
    
- When your program **accesses a virtual page**, the **MMU** tries to translate it.
    
- If no mapping exists (or it's swapped out), it triggers a **page fault**.
    
- The kernel **handles the page fault**, allocates a **page frame** (if needed), and updates the **page table**.
    

---

## üî∑ Step 4: `main()` Starts Running

Now the `main()` function begins:

`char msg[] = "Hello, World!";`

- This line creates a local variable on the **stack**.
    
- The string `"Hello, World!"` is stored in the **data segment** (because it‚Äôs a string literal).
    
- Both stack and data segment pages are mapped and allocated when accessed.
    

---

## üî∑ Step 5: `printf("%s\n", msg);`

When `printf` is called:

- The function `printf()` is part of **libc**, a shared library loaded into your address space.
    
- The code for `printf` executes from **read-only executable pages** shared across processes.
    

Internally:

- `printf()` prepares your message.
    
- It makes a **system call** to write to standard output:
    -> write(1, "Hello, World!\n", 14);
    
- This causes a **trap into kernel mode**.
    
- The kernel accesses your buffer (`msg`) via virtual memory, translates it via page table ‚Üí physical memory.
    
- Then it writes to the terminal (usually a file descriptor pointing to `/dev/pts/...`).
    

---

## üî∑ Step 6: Program Exits

When `main()` returns:

- `exit()` is called (explicitly or implicitly).
    
- The kernel:
    
    - Frees all the physical pages.
        
    - Deletes the page table.
        
    - Reclaims virtual memory.
        
- The process is destroyed, and its memory is gone.
    

---

## üìä Virtual Memory in Action (Step-by-Step)

|Step|What Happens|VM Involved?|
|---|---|---|
|`./my_program`|Shell calls `execve()`|Yes|
|Load binary|Kernel creates new address space|Yes|
|Access code (`main`)|Text segment mapped, maybe faulted|Yes|
|Use stack|Stack pages allocated on demand|Yes|
|Access string literal|Data segment page mapped|Yes|
|`printf()`|Shared library mapped + executed|Yes|
|`write()` syscall|Kernel translates user buffer to RAM|Yes|
|Exit|OS reclaims all pages|Yes|

---

## üß† Key Takeaways

- The **program never directly touches RAM** ‚Äî it works in **virtual addresses**.
    
- The **OS + MMU** do all the heavy lifting to **map** virtual memory to physical memory.
    
- The system only **allocates memory when it‚Äôs actually accessed** (lazy allocation).
    
- Each memory access may trigger a **page fault** ‚Äî and that‚Äôs totally normal.
    
- ‚≠ê Shared libraries (like `libc`) are **mapped into all processes‚Äô address spaces**, but only **one copy exists in RAM** (shared).
    

---

## üîß Want to See This Live?

You can observe this on Linux/macOS:

### üîç Check memory mappings of a running process:

```sh
ps aux | grep my_program cat /proc/<PID>/maps  # On Linux
```

### üß† Monitor page faults:

```sh
vmstat 1
```

Or run your program with `strace` and look for:

```sh
mmap() page_fault() read() write()
```

### What ‚Äúexecve‚Äù stands for (the name)

The name is built from parts:

- `exec` = execute (i.e. run a program)
- `v` = ‚Äúvector‚Äù (since it takes a vector/array `argv`)
- `e` = ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù (since it takes `envp` as environment variable vector) [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50421197/what-does-the-ve-in-execve-mean?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

So `execve` means ‚Äúexecute this file, with the given argument vector and environment vector.‚Äù

The arguments to `execve()` include:

1. `path` (a string) ‚Äî path to the executable file
2. `argv` ‚Äî argument vector (array of strings) passed to the new program
3. `envp` ‚Äî environment variables (array of strings) passed to the new program

- ELF = **Executable and Linkable Format**. It‚Äôs the standard binary format on Linux/Unix for executables, shared libraries, object files, core dumps. [Wikipedia+2OSDev Wiki+2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 4. Heap: what memory goes there

Yes ‚Äî the heap is for dynamic memory: memory you request at runtime, such as via `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, or in C++ via `new`. Also memory for dynamic arrays or containers (like `std::vector`)
Essentially anything that cannot be determined at compile time and must be allocated/deallocated during execution goes on the heap.

### What is ‚Äútrap into kernel mode‚Äù?

- User-space code executes in a **less privileged mode** (user mode). It cannot directly perform I/O or privileged instructions.
    
- When you do a system call (like `write()`), the CPU uses a special instruction (e.g. `syscall` or `int 0x80`) to **switch to kernel mode** (higher privilege). That is often called a ‚Äútrap‚Äù or ‚Äúsoftware interrupt.‚Äù
    
- In kernel mode, the OS code runs and does the actual work (e.g. writing to a device).
    
- Then control returns back to user space (back to your program) after the system call finishes.
    

This is how user programs request services from the OS.

### What does ‚Äúwrites to the terminal (file descriptor pointing to `/dev/pts/...`)‚Äù mean?

- In Unix, many things (including terminals) are represented as files.
    
- When you open a terminal session, you get a pseudo-terminal device, typically under `/dev/pts/X` (for Linux).
    
- Standard output (`fd = 1`) is connected to this terminal device file. So `write(1, buffer, n)` actually writes to `/dev/pts/X`.
    
- The kernel code handling `write()` figures out this device mapping and sends characters to the terminal (which displays them).
